# Trivia Quest 

# Overview

Our team created an educational based game aimed towards a middle school level audience. The player will experience exploring dungeons, answering fun questions and battling enemies throughout their quest! We incorporated different subjects to test their knowledge and implemented a score and health system within the game. 

The keys used for the game are:

* W,A,S,D to move the sprite around the map
* Space to attack enemies
* Left click on mouse to answer questions

Run the `__main__.py` file to start the game. <br>
Enjoy Trivia Quest!
